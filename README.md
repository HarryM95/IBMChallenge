The REST Service runs by default on http://localhost:8080/IBMrest/rest/.

http://localhost:8080/IBMrest/rest/filmsService/ - shows the list of all films (title, locations)

http://localhost:8080/IBMrest/rest/filmsService/{title} - filters the result by the title. 

Try for example:

	http://localhost:8080/IBMrest/rest/filmsService/Basic%20Instinct
